The triangleAlign class contains a 5th alignment type that outputs the text as a right triangle. 
EX:
*
**
***
****
***** etc etc
To implement this feature just type "triangle" instead of left, right, justify, or center. It works with all 4 text files given but the maxmimum line length input wont be utlized for this to keep the triangle formatt as stable as possible. You still need to enter a valid 3rd argument in the command line however, it just wont effect the output. It is the same compiling as the other .java files: javac triangleAlign.java.
EX command line: java TextAlignment java.txt triangle 60
